#cltool

Example command line tool install using easy_install/pip/etc

This builds a tiny egg that installs two command line tools, 'cltool' and 'cltool2'. cltool is a command line tool that uses raw bash, cltool2 is a python script that can be run as a command line tool.

This project was written to teach myself how to do this, and due to the dearth of good tutorials. 

## Installing cltool 
To install cltool,  you can simply run 
    pip install cltool
Once that is done, cltool package will be installed, and the commands *cltool*, *cltool2* and *cltool3* will be avaliable from your command line. If you want to see exactly which cltool or cltool2 was installed, you can simply run 
    which cltool
to see where on your system python deposits it's scripts linkage.
