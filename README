Example command line tool install using easy_install/pip/etc

This builds a tiny egg that installs two command line tools, 'cltool' and 'cltool2'. cltool is a command line tool that uses raw bash, cltool2 is a python script that can be run as a command line tool.

This project was written to teach myself how to do this, and due to the dearth of good tutorials.
