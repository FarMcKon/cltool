# Document on how to release well.

## Testing
Do testing [on TestPyPi](./TESTING.md).

## Releasing
Register for [an account on PyPi](http://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form).  Then simply run
    
    python setup.py register sdist bdist_egg upload 

of course, once that is done, you'll want to test installing it by running:

    pip install --upgrade --verbose <your_module_name>
